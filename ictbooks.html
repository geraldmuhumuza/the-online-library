    <br><p>C By Example is designed to make programming easy to learn for the beginning programmer. 
        It builds the reader's programming skills by using clear, easy-to-understand exercises. Hands-on,
         real world examples show readers how to write programs that flow correctly and produce accurate results.
          At the end of the book, readers will use the concepts they learned in the book to build a blackjack game. It also includes an appendix
           that discusses where to find compilers, other C resources, where to go from here, and what kinds of careers the readers could
            go into with the knowledge she gained from the book.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Welcome to the Eighth Edition of Introduction to Programming Using Java, a free,
         on-line textbook on introductory programming, which uses Java as the language 
         of instruction. This book is directed mainly towards beginning programmers,
          although it might also be useful for experienced programmers who want to 
          learn something about Java. It is not meant to provide complete coverage of
           the Java language.

        The eighth edition requires Java 8 or later, and it uses JavaFX for GUI programming. Version 8.1 is a small update of Version 8.0. This version briefly covers some of the new features in Java 11 and makes it clearer how to use this book with Java 11 and later.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented 
        computer programming language like Java. You might think the problem is your brain. 
        It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the 
        dry, technical stuff you're forced to study.
       <br>

       The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for
         something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay 
         alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background
          so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How 
          does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach 
          say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in 
          your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain
           knows.
       <br>
        And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong 
        visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage
         you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its
          playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to 
          object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals
           to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming 
           with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the 
           Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the
            platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation 
            is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever.
        <br>
       If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format
         designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll 
         see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.
        <br>
        By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to
         learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what
          you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer.
           If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, 
           this book's for you.</p><br>

        This book is designed to help you teach yourself how to program with C++.
         In just 21 days, you'lllearn about such fundamentals as managing I/O, loops 
         and arrays, object-oriented programming,templates, and creating C++ 
         applications--all in well-structured and easy-to-follow lessons. Lessonsprovide
          sample listings--complete with sample output and an analysis of the code--to

    Modern Systems Analysis and Design is your practical guide to the concepts, skills, 
    methodologies, techniques and tools needed to develop information systems as a systems
     analyst. Successful completion of an introductory course on computer systems and
      experience designing programs in at least 1 programming language are a proper 
      foundation for this text. Drawing on the systems development life cycle, the authors
       will provide you with a conceptual and systematic framework while progressing 
       through essential topics <br>

The 9th Edition updates reflect the changing environment for systems development, with a 
renewed focus on agile methodologies. Throughout the text, screen captures, figures, 
tables, and related content have been refreshed. References to more than 100 books, 
journals, and websites have also been made current.

    <br>
    <p>The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) 
        with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and 
        exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other 
        communications networks.[1][2][3][4][5] The Internet of things is an example 
        of Electronics & Communication and Computer Science engineering. "Internet of 
        things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected
         to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network,[6] and be
          individually addressable.[7][8]<br>

        including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, and increasingly powerful 
        embedded systems, as well as machine learning.[9] Older fields of embedded systems,
        wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building
         automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things.[10] In 
         the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with "smart home" products,
          including devices and appliances (lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security 
          systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common
           ecosystems[clarification needed], and can be controlled via devices associated 
           with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in
            healthcare systems.[11]<br>
        
        There are a number of concerns about the risks in the growth of IoT technologies 
        and products, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently 
        there have been industry and government moves to address these concerns, including 
        the development of international and local standards, guidelines, and regulatory
         frameworks.[12]</p>
